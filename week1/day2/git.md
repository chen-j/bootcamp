**Git** is a tool that allows groups of people to **collaborate** on the same code without getting in each other's way.

It's a version control system because it keeps your code's history as a series of checkpoints or versions.

Commits are the building blocks of a repo

A commit is a "photo" of code uniquely identified by a *sha*
